# **Project Title: Textile Design Search System**

## Description
Textile Design Search System is a software solution developed to address the challenge of finding similar textile designs from a vast local database. The system utilizes image processing techniques and search algorithms to enable efficient searching and matching of textile designs. With this system, manufacturer like Salasar Fashion can enhance their design selection process, save time, and improve productivity.

I undertook contract that helped Salasar Fashion, a pioneer in Textile Industry to help them search similar textile designs from their root design database of nearly 2TB size, and 1,00,000+ images.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Flask web framework
* OpenCV library
* NumPy library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/salasar-fashion/design-search-system.git

   '''

## Example
To demonstrate the functionality of the Textile Design Search System, follow these steps:

1. Start the application by running the app.py file.
2. Access the system through a web browser by entering the URL http://localhost:5000.
3. Place your directory of images in 'files/static/dataset/' folder
4. Index images
5. Upload a design image using the "Upload a Design" form.
6. Specify the number of similar images to display.
7. Click the "Search" button.
8. The system will process the uploaded image and retrieve the most similar designs from the database.
9. The search results will be displayed, showing the similar designs along with their distances and paths.
